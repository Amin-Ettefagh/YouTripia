        Youtripia is a platform that allows users to take advantage of available
        passenger load capacity to deliver parcels to a destination city or
        country. It provides a faster and more cost-effective alternative to
        traditional cargo services, enabling users to send items quickly and
        affordably. Passengers carrying the parcels are compensated with a
        stipend upon successful delivery, based on mutual agreements. The
        platform connects people with excess capacity (servers) and those with
        delivery needs (clients), facilitating value exchange through a
        collaborative system.
